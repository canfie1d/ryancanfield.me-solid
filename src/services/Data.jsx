Its rare to find that combination where the frontend engineer truly understands the principles of usability and functional product design. We have had to pivot our tech focus a few times and each time we were able to get from idea to MVP to v1 in record time because of Ryan's ability to logically think through and problem solve. He is able to get his idea into a clickable demo version very quickly and from there the team iterates on the design and functionality till we get to something very close to the actual requirements. Doing it this way makes for fail fast iteration cycles and getting to a working product much faster. His work is of the highest quality with very few bugs (if any) escaping to production.",

In addition to his dependability he is great at understanding the business or user needs behind what he is building and contributing to the design at an early stage as well as suggesting more efficient ways to accomplish the objectives based on his knowledge of the codebase.
